CHAPTER 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Define the term ”Protocol” in the context of the Internet.
A protocol is a set of rules and standards that determine how data is sent, received, and interpreted between devices on the
 Internet.
Protocols ensure that computers can communicate correctly, even if they use different hardware or software.

2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?
           Web Browser	                                                                 Search Engine
A software application used to access and display web pages	        A web service used to find information on the Internet
It works on your device	                                            It works online
It opens websites using URLs	                                    It searches websites using keywords
Examples: Chrome, Firefox, Edge	                                    Examples: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo

3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interconnected web pages and websites that can be accessed through the Internet using a
web browser.
It uses hyperlinks to connect documents and mainly works with the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
Static Web Page                         Dynamic Web Page                                  
 In static content is fixed          In dynamic content changes                               
Same for all users                   Different for different users                      
Uses only HTML and CSS               Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side languages 
No database connection               Connected to a database                           
Example: Personal portfolio          Example: Facebook, Online banking  

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)
5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
The client-server architecture of the web is a system where a client (typically a web browser) sends a request for resources 
or services to a server, which processes the request and sends the data back to the client . This interaction is the 
foundation of how the internet works, dividing responsibilities between the requester and the provider of information. 
 
 Key Component 
Client: The client is a software application that initiates communication with the server. Common examples include web 
browsers (like Chrome,Firefox, or Safari), which run on devices such as desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, or tablets. 
The client is responsible for formatting he request, sending it to the server, and rendering the response for the user.

Server: The server is a powerful computer or system of computers running specialized software (like Apache, Nginx, or
 Microsoft IIS) that manages network resources and responds to client requests [1]. Servers store websites, databases, and
application logic. 

6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
i.Email (Electronic Mail)
-Email allows users to send and receive messages electronically over the Internet.
-Messages can include text, images, attachments, and documents.
-It provides a way for fast, reliable, and asynchronous communication,
meaning the sender and receiver do not need to be online at the same time.
 Examples: Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook.

ii.FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
-FTP is used to transfer files between a client and a server over the Internet.
-It allows users to upload files to a server (e.g., website files) or download files from a server.
 Examples: Uploading website content to a hosting server, downloading software updates.

iii.VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
-VoIP allows users to make voice calls using the Internet instead of traditional telephone lines.
-It converts voice signals into digital data packets and transmits them over the network.
 Examples: Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp calls.

4.”The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works.
The statement “The Internet is a network of networks” means that the Internet is not a single network, but a global system 
formed by connecting many smaller networks such as home networks, school networks, corporate networks, Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs), and backbone networks. These independent networks are interconnected using common protocols, mainly TCP/IP,
 allowing devices worldwide to communicate with each other.
 
Packet Switching Work by the folling point:-
-Segmentation: A message, file, or request (like a webpage download) is broken down into smaller pieces (packets) by the 
sending device.
-Addressing : Each packet is given a header containing essential information: the source IP address, the destination IP address,
the total number of packets in the message, and the sequence number of that specific packet .
-Transmission and Routing : The packets are then transmitted across the network, traveling independently .Router along the way 
read the destination address in each packet's header and use complex algorithms to determine the most efficient path for
that moment. This means that different packets from the same message may take completely different physical routes across the 
Internet.
-Reassembly : Once the packets arrive at their destination, the receiving device uses the sequence numbers to eorder them correctly.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to allvisitors and requires very low
maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to usea dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your 
answer.
 I would disagree with the advice to use a dynamic website for a startup with the specified needs. A static website is the best
Every visitor sees the same pages, which makes a static site ideal for basic information such as company details, services, contact
information, and announcements. In contrast, a dynamic website is used when content needs to change frequently or be customized for
different users, which is not required in this case.

Reasons.
Static website 
-It consist of fixed HTML poges that showidentical content to every visitor.
-They are cheaper to develop and  host since no server side processing or database are required.
-Maintenance is minimal because there is no backad logic, database, os frequent update. 
-It's facter and more sexure due to server side script.
-It is suitable for startups, company profiles, and informational websites.

Dynamic Website 
-It displays different or updated content based on users or data.
-It content is generated at runtime.
-It uses server-side programming (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.)..
-It requires regular updates and security management.
-Its suitable for e-commerce websites, blogs, and web applications.

9.A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not Found” error, even though the internet connection
is active. However, accessing the site via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that failed.
The problem is a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS). While our internet connection is active, our browser cannot translate 
human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into the numerical IP address (142.250.190.46) necessary for communication.

The failure is confirmed because:
Accessing the site by its IP address (142.250.190.46) works, meaning the Google server is operational and your internet connection is 
functional.
Accessing the site by its domain name (www.google.com) fails, indicating the step of finding that IP address from the name is not working 

The underlying technology that failed are :-
-Local DNS Cache Issue: Our computer might have outdated or corrupted DNS information stored locally.
-ISP's DNS Server is Down or Misconfigured: The DNS server provided by your ISP may be experiencing a temporary outage or configuration
 error .
- Network Configuration Errors: Problems with your router or firewall settings might be blocking DNS traffic.
- Malware or Security Software: Sometimes, security software or malware can interfere with DNS requests, potentially redirecting them or
  blocking them entirely. 

10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers but does not want this information
available to the general public. Explain which network type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why
An Extranet is the most suitable network type for this situation because it is designed specifically for secure collaboration with 
external organizations.
In a multinational corporation, inventory data is sensitive and should not be visible to the general public. At the same time, 
suppliers need access to this data so they can plan production, deliveries, and restocking. An Extranet solves this problem by 
extending the company’s internal network to selected external users only. 
An Extranet works by this way:
-It is built on the company’s Intranet but opens limited access to trusted partners.
- It suppliers log in through secure authentication (usernames, passwords, certificates, or VPNs).
-ItAccess is restricted to specific data and applications, such as inventory levels, orders, or shipment status.
-It security measures like firewalls, encryption, and access control ensure data protection.

Extranet is better  than Internet and Intranet:
Intranet: Too restrictive—only employees can access it, so suppliers would be excluded.
Internet: Too open—anyone could access the information, creating serious security risks.
