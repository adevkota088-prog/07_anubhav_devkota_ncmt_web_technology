1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.
A sitemap is a detailed representation of all the pages of a website and the relationships between 
them. It is created during the planning phase to organize the website structure, plan navigation, 
and ensure that users can easily move from one page to another. Sitemaps help designers and developers
understand the overall layout of the website before development begins.

2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?
The launch phase is the final stage of web development where the website is deployed to a live 
server and made accessible to users. During this phase, final testing is performed to check for 
errors, security issues, and performance problems. The purpose of the launch phase is to ensure 
the website works correctly in a real environment and is ready for public use.

3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
Documentation is important because it provides detailed information about the system design,
source code, and development processes. It helps developers understand how the application works,
makes maintenance and future updates easier, and supports teamwork. Proper documentation also 
saves time when debugging issues or handing the project over to new developers.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.

Front-end development focuses on the client-side part of a website that users see and interact with,
such as layouts, buttons, and forms. It uses technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create 
an attractive and user-friendly interface.

Back-end development focuses on the server-side operations of a website, including database 
management, authentication, and business logic. It uses server-side programming languages and
databases to process user requests and send data to the front end.

5. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
Planning is considered the most critical phase of web development because it lays the foundation for
 the entire project. Proper planning helps avoid errors, reduces development cost, and ensures that 
 the website meets user and business requirements. The key activities performed during the planning 
 phase are:
Requirement Analysis
In this activity, the goals of the website are identified. Client requirements, target users, and 
the purpose of the website are clearly defined.

Defining Website Objectives
The main objectives such as informing users, selling products, or providing services are determined
 to guide the design and development process.

Creating Sitemap and Navigation Structure
A sitemap is prepared to show all web pages and their relationships. This helps in planning clear 
and user-friendly navigation.

Content Planning
The type of content such as text, images, videos, and documents required for each page is planned in
advance.

Technology Selection
Appropriate technologies like programming languages, frameworks, databases, and hosting platforms are
selected based on project needs.

Budget and Time Planning
Project cost, resources, and development timeline are estimated to ensure smooth execution.

Risk Analysis and Feasibility Study
Possible technical, financial, and security risks are identified, and the feasibility of 
the project is evaluated.

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?
The maintenance phase of web development is iterative because it is a continuous and
repeating process rather than a one-time activity. After a website is launched, it requires
regular updates, monitoring, and improvements to remain effective and relevant.
During maintenance, developers repeatedly perform activities such as fixing bugs, updating
content, improving performance, and applying security patches. User feedback is reviewed,
problems are identified, solutions are implemented, and the website is tested again. This 
cycle continues throughout the life of the website, making the maintenance phase iterative
in nature.
A website is never truly “finished” because user needs change, technologies evolve, and
security threats continuously emerge. New features may be required, content must be updated,
and design trends change over time. To remain useful, secure, and competitive, a website
must be regularly improved and adapted, which makes ongoing maintenance essential.

7. Describe the process of “Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?

Information gathering is the initial step of the web development process where detailed data
about the project is collected before planning and design begin. During this process, developers 
and designers communicate with clients or stakeholders to understand the purpose of the website, 
business goals, required features, content needs, and technical constraints. Information is
gathered through meetings, interviews, questionnaires, market research, and analysis of similar 
existing websites. This step helps in defining clear requirements and expectations for the project.

Understanding the target audience is crucial during information gathering because the
website is ultimately built for its users. Knowing the audience’s age, interests,
technical skills, language, and browsing behavior helps in making correct decisions about 
design, layout, content style, navigation, and functionality. When the target audience is
well understood, the website becomes more user-friendly, effective, and aligned with user 
needs, leading to better engagement and success.

8. Scenario-Based Question: Risks of Skipping the Testing Phase

As the project manager of a new e-commerce website, skipping the testing phase to save money and launch early can create serious risks that may harm both the business and its customers.

First, security risks are very high in e-commerce systems because they handle sensitive data
such as customer personal information, login credentials, and payment details. Without 
proper testing, security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, data leaks, or weak 
authentication may remain undiscovered. This can lead to hacking, financial loss, and loss
of customer trust.

Second, skipping testing can cause functionality issues. Important features such as product
search, shopping cart, checkout, payment processing, and order confirmation may not work 
correctly. Errors in these functions can result in failed transactions, incorrect orders,
and frustrated customers, directly affecting sales and reputation.

Third, there are compatibility problems. Without testing on different browsers, devices, 
and screen sizes, the website may not function properly on mobile phones, tablets, or 
certain browsers. This can cause layout issues, broken features, or slow performance for 
many users.

9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating
a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what
went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled
In this scenario, the main problem occurred because the developer skipped the planning and 
design phases and started coding immediately after the first client meeting. Without creating 
a sitemap or a design prototype (wireframe/mockup), the developer did not clearly define the
website structure, navigation, and visual layout. As a result, the client’s expectations were 
not properly understood or validated, which led to the rejection of the layout midway through 
development.

What went wrong is that there was no early client feedback on the structure and design of 
the website. Coding without prior approval of design increases the risk of misunderstandings, 
rework, wasted time, and increased cost. The absence of a sitemap also meant unclear navigation 
and page organization, making it difficult to align the website with the client’s goals.

This situation should have been handled by following a proper development process. First, 
the developer should have conducted thorough information gathering to understand the client’s 
requirements. Then, a sitemap should have been created to define page structure, followed by 
design prototypes or wireframes to visualize the layout. These designs should have been reviewed 
and approved by the client before coding began. This approach would have ensured clarity, reduced 
rework, saved time, and resulted in a website that met the client’s expectations.

10.A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped 
visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle
was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.
In this case, the Maintenance phase of the web development lifecycle was neglected. Although 
the website was launched successfully, it failed to remain useful to students because the 
content (exam schedules) was not updated regularly. This shows that ongoing updates and 
monitoring were not performed after the launch.

Activities involved in the Maintenance phase include:

Content Updates
Regularly updating information such as news, schedules, events, and announcements to keep the website relevant.

Bug Fixes
Identifying and fixing errors or broken links that appear after the website is live.

Performance Optimization
Improving website speed, responsiveness, and user experience over time.

Security Updates
Applying patches and updates to protect the website from vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks.

User Feedback Analysis
Collecting feedback from users to improve usability, features, and design.

Adding New Features
Introducing new functionalities as the needs of users evolve.
