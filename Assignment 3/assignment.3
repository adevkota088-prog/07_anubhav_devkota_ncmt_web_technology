Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
Information Architecture (IA) is the process of organizing, structuring, and labeling 
website content so that users can easily find and understand information.
It focuses on navigation, menus, categories, and content hierarchy.

2. What is a “Wireframe”?
A wireframe is a basic visual blueprint of a website that shows the layout and placement 
of elements like headers, menus, content areas, and buttons without colors or images.
It helps designers plan structure before actual development.

3. Explain the concept of “Cognitive Friction” in web design.
Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort required by users when a website is 
confusing, cluttered, or difficult to navigate.
High cognitive friction makes users feel frustrated and increases bounce rate.

4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
Hyphens (-) are preferred because search engines treat hyphens as word separators, while underscores (_) are not.
Example:
web-design-basics (Good for SEO)
web_design_basics (Poor readability & SEO)

5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure
Hierarchical (Tree) Structure
The hierarchical structure organizes a website in a top-down manner, where the home page
is the root and other pages are arranged as main categories and sub-categories. Users can
move freely between sections using menus and links. This structure is ideal for large 
and complex websites.
Characteristics:
Clear parent–child relationship
Easy to expand (scalable)
Supports multiple navigation paths
Good for information-heavy websites
Example:
A University website where the Home page leads to Admissions, Departments, Library, 
Alumni, etc., and each department has its own sub-pages.

Linear (Sequential) Structure
The linear structure presents content in a fixed order, where users must follow one step
after another. Navigation is controlled, and skipping steps is usually not allowed. This 
structure is best for task-based or instructional websites.
Characteristics:
Step-by-step navigation
Simple and guided flow
Less user control
Not suitable for large websites
Example:
An online examination system or checkout process where users must complete one step before
moving to the next.

Comparison Table:
Basis	          Hierarchical Structure	      Linear Structure
Navigation	         Multiple paths              	Single path
User freedom	     High	                        Low
Website size	     Large websites	                Small / task-based
Flexibility	         High	                        Limited   

6. Explain the “Three-Click Rule” and its significance in UX design

The Three-Click Rule states that a user should be able to find any information on a website 
within three clicks. If users take more than three clicks, they may feel confused, frustrated, 
or lose interest.

Importance in UX Design:
Reduces cognitive friction
Improves ease of use
Saves user time
Increases user satisfaction
Decreases bounce rate

Example:
If a student wants to find admission requirements, it should be reachable within three 
clicks:
Home → Admissions → Requirements
This rule encourages designers to build clear menus, logical structure, and efficient 
navigation.

7. “Plan before you do.” How Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure
Card Sorting
Card sorting is a technique where content items are written on cards, and users are asked 
to group them in a way that makes sense to them.

How it helps:
Reveals how users think
Helps create logical categories
Improves menu labeling
Reduces user confusion
Example:
Users may group “Courses”, “Departments”, and “Faculty” under “Academics”.

Flowcharts
Flowcharts are visual diagrams that show how users move from one page to another on a 
website.

How it helps:
Shows navigation paths clearly
Identifies unnecessary steps
Improves user journey
Helps developers and designers understand structure

Conclusion:
By using card sorting and flowcharts, designers can plan the website structure properly 
before development, resulting in a simple, organized, and user-friendly website.

8. You are designing a website for a University. It has hundreds of pages (Admissions, 
Departments, Alumni, News). Which structural model would you choose? Draw a rough
For a university website with hundreds of pages like Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News,
the best structural model is usually a Hierarchical (Tree) Structure

It's is important because of:
Clear organization: Pages are grouped into main categories (like Admissions, Departments, Alumni).
Easy navigation: Users can start from the homepage and drill down to subpages.
Scalability: New departments or sections can easily be added without breaking the structure.
Example: Homepage → Admissions → Undergraduate → Application Process

Homepage
│
├── Admissions
│    ├── Undergraduate
│    ├── Postgraduate
│    └── International Students
│
├── Departments
│    ├── Computer Science
│    │    ├── Faculty
│    │    └── Research
│    ├── Physics
│    └── Mathematics
│
├── Alumni
│    ├── Alumni Events
│    └── Alumni Stories
│
├── News & Events
│    ├── University News
│    └── Upcoming Events

9. A user visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation menu, 
which is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen. Analyze this design failure using the ”KISS” 
(Keep It Simple) principle.
Scenario Recap

User visits a website.
Navigation menu is hidden behind a small icon (like a hamburger menu).
On a desktop screen, this is unexpected.
User leaves within 10 seconds.
KISS Principle
KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid (or "Keep It Simple and Straightforward")
The idea: avoid unnecessary complexity in design.
Users should understand and use the interface immediately without confusion.
Analysis of Design Failure
Unnecessary Complexity
Hiding the navigation menu behind a small icon adds extra cognitive effort.
On desktop screens, users expect visible menus, not hidden ones.

Poor Usability
Users couldn’t easily find what they were looking for.
Frustration causes high bounce rate (leaving within 10 seconds).

Violation of KISS
The interface is not simple or intuitive.
Keeping the navigation visible on desktops would have kept it simple.

Impact
Website loses visitors.
User experience suffers.
Potentially reduces conversions or engagement.
How to Fix (Following KISS)
Show the full navigation menu on desktops instead of hiding it.
Only use collapsible menus on mobile screens where space is limited.
Make important elements easy to find and use.

10. An e-commerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9. Explain 
why this is bad for both users and Search Engines (SEO), and propose a better structure using 
Page Slugs
For Users:
Unreadable & Confusing: Users cannot understand what the page is about just by looking at the URL. prod?id=55&cat=9 tells nothing about the product.
Difficult to Remember or Share: URLs with parameters like ?id=55&cat=9 are hard to memorize or share.
Poor Trust: Users may feel uncertain about clicking a link with strange codes.


For Search Engines (SEO):

Unfriendly for Crawling: Search engines prefer URLs that describe the page content. Parameter-heavy URLs are harder 
for crawlers to index properly.
No Keywords: This URL does not include any relevant keywords like product name or category, which reduces SEO effectiveness.
Duplicate Content Risk: URLs with different parameters could point to the same product, creating duplicate content issues.

Better Structure Using Page Slugs
Page slugs are the readable part of the URL, typically derived from the product name or category.
A better URL structure is:
www.shop.com/electronics/smartphone-iphone-14

Explanation:


electronics → Category of the product


smartphone-iphone-14 → Product name as a slug


Benefits:

User-Friendly: Easy to read, understand, and share.
SEO-Friendly: Includes keywords (smartphone, iPhone 14), which improves search engine ranking.
Clean & Simple: No confusing parameters, reduces cognitive friction.
