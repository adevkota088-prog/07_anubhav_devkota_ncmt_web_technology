1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability
Aspect	         Legibility	                                                              Readability
Meaning	   How easy it is to recognize individual letters or characters in text.	      How easy it is to read and understand a block of text (sentences/paragraphs).
Focus	   Fonts, letter spacing, size, contrast	                                      Sentence structure, line spacing, content organization
Example	   Arial is more legible than decorative fonts.                                   Short sentences and proper paragraphs improve readability.

2. What is the “Rule of Thirds” in layout design?
The Rule of Thirds is a visual design principle that divides a layout into 3 equal horizontal and 3 equal vertical sections (like a tic-tac-toe grid).
Important elements (text, images, buttons) are placed along the lines or at intersections.
Purpose: Makes the design more balanced, visually appealing, and easier for users to focus on key content.

3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?
Using too many fonts creates visual clutter and looks unprofessional.
Consistency: Fewer fonts improve user experience and help brand recognition.
Performance: Loading multiple fonts can slow down page loading speed.
Rule of Thumb: Usually 1–2 font families are enough (one for headings, one for body text).

4. Define “Responsive Web Design”
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to designing websites so that they automatically adjust and look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, mobiles).
Techniques used: Flexible grids, flexible images, media queries (CSS).
Purpose: Enhances usability, accessibility, and SEO.

5.Explain the ”F-Pattern” of scanning and how it influences the placement of content on a web page.
The F-Pattern describes how users typically read or scan web pages, especially pages with lots of 
text, such as articles or search results. Eye-tracking studies show that users’ eyes move in a 
pattern resembling the letter “F”:
Top Horizontal Movement:
Users first scan across the top of the page (the first horizontal line), reading headings or the 
first few words.
This is the most attention-grabbing area.

Second Horizontal Movement:
Users then scan a shorter horizontal line below the first, usually across subheadings or important phrases.

Vertical Scan:
Finally, users scan the left side vertically, quickly glancing down the page.
They focus on the beginning of each line, ignoring much of the content on the right.
Influence on Content Placement

Place important content on the top-left:
Headlines, key messages, and call-to-actions (CTAs) should be near the top or left side of the page.

Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs:
Helps users quickly find what they are looking for as they scan vertically.

Highlight important keywords on the first few words of lines:
Ensures critical information is seen even if the user only glances at the left side.

Images and buttons:
Should align with the natural scanning pattern, e.g., top or along the F’s horizontal bars.

6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design. Give examples of where Blue, Red, and Green should be used.
Colors are not just aesthetic—they affect users’ emotions, perception, and behavior on a website. Using the right colors can enhance usability, brand perception, and conversions.

Common color psychology:

Color	Psychological Impact	                                      Example Usage in Web Design
Blue	Trust, security, calmness, professionalism	Banking websites, tech companies, social media (e.g., Facebook, PayPal)
Red	Urgency, excitement, energy, attention-grabbing	Sale buttons, call-to-action (CTA), warning messages
Green	Growth, safety, relaxation, eco-friendly	Success messages, nature-related websites, health products

7. Explain the ”60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance on a website.
The 60-30-10 Rule is a guideline for color proportioning on a website to create a balanced, visually appealing design:

60% - Dominant Color:
Usually the background color or main theme.
ets the overall tone of the site.

30% - Secondary Color:
Supports the dominant color and is used for secondary elements like sidebars, menus, or highlights.

10% - Accent Color:
Used sparingly to draw attention to important elements like buttons, links, or CTAs.

Example:
Website background (dominant) → White → 60%
Menu, banners, sidebar (secondary) → Light Gray → 30%
Buttons, links, highlights (accent) → Red → 10%

Benefits:
Maintains visual harmony
Guides users’ focus naturally
Avoids color clutter

8. A website loads very slowly, causing users to abandon it. Upon inspection, you find the
developer used high-resolution raw images directly from a camera. Explain the importance
of Image Optimization and file formats (JPEG vs PNG) to solve this
A website is slow because high-resolution raw images were used directly from a camera. Users leave before the page loads.

Importance of Image Optimization
Image optimization means reducing file size without compromising visual quality to improve:

Website Speed:
Smaller images load faster, reducing page load time.
Faster pages increase user engagement and reduce bounce rates.

SEO Benefits:
Search engines like Google prioritize fast-loading websites.
Optimized images improve overall page ranking.

Better User Experience:
Quick-loading pages retain users and improve satisfaction.
Mobile users benefit especially due to limited bandwidth.

Reduced Bandwidth and Storage:
Smaller images consume less server space and data.

Choosing File Formats: JPEG vs PNG
File Format	Best For	Pros	Cons
JPEG	Photographs, realistic images	High compression, small file size	Loses some quality (lossy), 
not ideal for transparency PNG	Logos, icons, images with transparency	Lossless, supports transparency	
Larger file size compared to JPEG, not ideal for photos

Rule of Thumb:
Use JPEG for photos or complex images where file size matters.
Use PNG for graphics, logos, or images that require transparency.
How to Solve the Problem
Resize Images:
Reduce image dimensions to what’s actually needed on the web.
Compress Images:
Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Photoshop “Save for Web.”
Choose Appropriate Format:
JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics/logos.

Lazy Loading (Optional):
Load images only when users scroll to them to save initial page load time.

Summary:
Optimized images with the correct file format make websites faster, user-friendly, and SEO-friendly,
preventing users from abandoning the site.

9. You are designing a website for a Law Firm. The client wants to use a bright yellow
background with Comic Sans font to look ”friendly.” As a web designer, critique this choice
based on Color Theory and Typography principles, and suggest a better alternative.
A Law Firm wants a bright yellow background and Comic Sans font to look “friendly.”

Critique Based on Web Design Principles
1. Color Theory
Bright yellow background:
Yellow is associated with happiness, energy, and friendliness, but too bright a yellow can be harsh on the eyes and reduce readability.
Law firms need to convey trust, professionalism, and reliability, which bright yellow may fail to communicate.
High contrast between text and bright yellow is difficult, making long text hard to read.

2. Typography
Comic Sans font:
Comic Sans is informal and playful, often perceived as unprofessional.
A law firm’s website should communicate credibility and seriousness, which this font fails to deliver.

Better Alternatives
1. Color Choice
Use neutral, calming, professional colors:
Navy Blue or Dark Blue → Trust, professionalism, authority
White or Light Gray background → Clean, readable, modern look
Accent colors like gold or muted yellow can be used sparingly for highlights or buttons

2. Typography
Use serif or modern sans-serif fonts:
Serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman, Georgia) → Convey tradition, reliability
Sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Roboto, Lato) → Clean, readable, modern look

Example Combination
Background: White
Headings: Dark Blue, Serif font (Georgia)
Body Text: Dark Gray, Sans-serif font (Roboto)
Accent: Gold buttons or links
Result: Professional, readable, trustworthy, yet visually appealing.

10.A website looks great on a laptop but is unreadable on a mobile phone because the user has to zoom in and scroll horizontally. Identify the design principle missing here and explain how Media Queries/Fluid Grids could fix it
A website looks fine on a laptop but is unreadable on mobile, requiring zooming and horizontal scrolling.
Missing Design Principle
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is missing.
Principle: A website should adapt its layout, images, and content to different screen sizes and devices.
Without responsiveness:
Users on mobile have poor experience.
Text may be too small.
Horizontal scrolling frustrates users.
How to Fix Using Media Queries and Fluid Grids
1. Media Queries (CSS)
Media queries allow different styles for different screen sizes.

Example:

/* For mobile devices (up to 600px width) */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 16px;       /* Increase readability */
    padding: 10px;         /* Avoid content touching edges */
  }
  nav {
    display: block;        /* Stack menu items vertically */
  }
}

Effect: Layout adjusts automatically for smaller screens.

2. Fluid Grids
Instead of fixed pixel widths, use relative units (%, em, rem) for elements:
Columns, images, and containers scale proportionally.
Example:
container {
  width: 90%;      /* Scales with screen size */
  margin: 0 auto;  /* Center container */
}

Effect: Content fits the screen width without horizontal scrolling.
